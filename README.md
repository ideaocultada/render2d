# Render2d
A very simple OpenGL 2D engine written in C.

## Examples
The engine itself is just plain C and OpenGL. It does not generate a window or a context for you. Some examples of how to use the engine are provided using [glfw](http://www.glfw.org/). You can build the examples by running 'scons' at the project root using [SCons](http://scons.org/).

## Misc
The project also includes the awesome [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) image library.
