# Render2d Extras
A collection of helpful, **optional**, modules you can choose to use with the library. These are used in the provided examples. They are intended to be bare-bones and dirt simple. Just like the renderer.

## Modules
* rexLogger - A utility that opens a log file and spams output.
* rexError - An error handling library that takes care of logging errors and exiting the program.
* rexMath - A very simple set of math functions and primitives.
* rexText - A bitmap text rendering utility.
* rexSDLTools - A set of utility functions that sets up and manages an SDL2 environment.
